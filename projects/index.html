							<h2>Classification in Medical Diagnostics</h2>
							<p>Objective: The goal of this project was to implement the k-nearest neighbor algorithm and Fisher's linear discriminant on the University of Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cytology data set in order to classify the data as either benign or malignant as well as to assess the accuracy of each method.</p> 
							<p>Data: The raw diagnostic data set included 32 attributes, 30 of which were used in the analysis, and 569 instances each labeled as benign or malignant. Processing began with the calculation of the mean, variance and standard deviation for each of the 30 attributes separately for the total dataset as well as both diangostic subsets. This exploratory analysis concluded that the attributes required normalization which was completed. </p>
							<p>Methods: 1NN, 3NN, Fisher's linear discriminant</p>
							<p>Analysis:	</p>			
							<p>Conclusion: </p>

							<h2>Modeling and Predicting Mortgage Customer Retention</h2>
							<p>Objective: A bank, looking to prevent the loss of mortgage customers at the end of the 'lock-in' period, asked for an analysis of customers' personal circumstances to determine if any variables significantly influence the customer's decision to stay or leave the bank. The goal of the analysis was to develop a generalized linear model that describes the given data as well as provides accurate prediction results for future use.</p>
							<p>Data: </p>
							<p>Methods: </p>
							<p>Analysis: </p>
							<p>Conclusion: The analysis resulted in a model that shows a significant relationship between a customer's account status and their choice in being a branch user, a direct/telephone user and having an agent. In other words, it is in the bank's best interests to place more importance on customers having a relationship with the bank as well as initiating specific points of contact in order to retain the most business.</p>

							<h2>Optimizing Dilution Rates for Nonlinear Functional Response</h2>
							<p>Objective: </p>
							The presence of nonlinear grazing by microzooplankton on phytoplankton populations creates challenges in obtaining appropriate data for accurate rate estimates through the dilution technique, specifically in regards to the number of dilutions included in the experiment as well as the levels of those dilutions. This research aimed to optimize the allocation of dilution rates to account for nonlinearity as well as to develop a new method to approximate the, normally unknown, functional response curve to improve upon current methods and models.
							In doing so, this paper demonstrates that a computational approach using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method as well as constrained and unconstrained nonlinear optimization is preferential to other approximated methods, especially in the necessary examination of multiple functional response curves. The results of the preiliminary new method indicated that the inclusion of multiple high dilution samples (<= 0.2), with at least one very highly diluted sample (<= 0.05), provides minimal error for both the parameter estimates as well as the associated functional response curve in comparison to the known true response.
							Therefore, this preliminary new method, though in need of refinement, shows promise as a tool to enhance the dilution technique method as well as to improve the progress and development of current plankton models for estimating the grazing rate of microzooplankton.
