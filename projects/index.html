							<h2>Classification in Medical Diagnostics</h2>
							<p><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal of this project was to implement the k-nearest neighbor algorithm and Fisher's linear discriminant on the University of Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cytology data set in order to classify the data as either benign or malignant as well as to assess the accuracy of each method.</p> 
							<p><strong>Data:</strong> The raw diagnostic data set included 32 attributes, 30 of which were used in the analysis, and 569 instances each labeled as benign or malignant. Processing began with the calculation of the mean, variance and standard deviation for each of the 30 attributes separately for the total dataset as well as both diangostic subsets. This exploratory analysis concluded that the attributes required normalization which was completed. </p>

							<h2>Modeling and Predicting Mortgage Customer Retention</h2>
							<p>A bank, looking to prevent the loss of mortgage customers at the end of the 'lock-in' period, asked for an analysis of customers' personal circumstances to determine if any variables significantly influence the customer's decision to stay or leave the bank.</p>
							<p><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal of the analysis was to develop a generalized linear model that describes the given data as well as provides accurate prediction results for future use.</p>
							<p><strong>Data:</strong> The data provided by the bank include information for 399 of their customers with 23 attributes describing the personal circumstances of the customer. After removing the redundant attributes, 18 explanatory variables were left, consisting of both discrete and continuous variables. In addition, two variables had missing values which were filled with the median/mode in regards to gender and 'Blank' for wealth code.</p>
							<p><strong>Methods:</strong> Due to the binary nature of the response variable, logistic regression and stepwise selection were utilized in this analysis. The assessment of model fit was determined using Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion, McFadden's pseudo-R-Squared, classification tables as well as residual deviance and p-value in the case of nested models.</p>
							<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The null model provides the initial comparison for AIC and BIC values. Begining with a single predictor, a set of models are created by adding each explanatory variable tot he null model to determine whether or not their presence improves model fit. For both AIC and BIC, models over the respective minimum are eliminated from further analysis. The minimum AIC and BIC for the set, as well as the maximum R-Squared and calculated accuracy percentages, are noted and used as the comparison values for the next set of models.</p>
							<p>Two predictor models are then created using all combinations of the remaining single predictor models. The same procedure is performed, only retaining the combinations of variables which meet at least three of the four criteria, elinimating all others and updating the minimums and maximums for comparison in the next set. For three-predictor models and above, only combinations of the previous models are created when one or more common variables is present.</p>
							<p>Once a model is found that crosses the threshold of the minimum AIC and BIC, as well as teh maximum R-Squared and accuracy rate, all variations of the interaction terms are added and assessed by the same criteria to determine if any interactions between variables improve the fit. In addition, if the model only contains categorical variables, the difference in residual deviance and the associated p-values are reviewed for the nested models.</p>
							<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The analysis resulted in a model that shows a significant relationship between a customer's account status and their choice in being a branch user, a direct/telephone user and having an agent. In other words, it is in the bank's best interests to place more importance on customers having a relationship with the bank as well as initiating specific points of contact in order to retain the most business.</p>

							<h2>Optimizing Dilution Rates for Nonlinear Functional Response</h2>
							<p>As the foundation of the oceanic food chain, as well as being a primary producer in the earth's carbon cycling, it is important to understand the population dynamics of phytoplankton and their microzooplankton predators. In order to understand these dynamics, scientists perform field experiments by diluting seawater at various rates before measuring population density of both prey and predator. Using the field experiment data, regression analysis is performed to determine estimates of both the growth and grazing rates.</p>
							<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Originally, when microzooplankton grazing was assumed to be a linear function of phytoplankton density, there were no drawbacks in choosing any two dilution rates as that would be sufficient to perform a linear regression. However, there exists a challenge in determining the optimal number of dilution treatments to perform as well as the best rates to achieve the most accurate estimates when nonlinear grazing is considered. Therefore, the aim of theis project is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the dilution experients by optimizing the allocation of dilution rates. This should produce more accurate estimates for both the phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing rates, especially in the case of nonlinear grazing. To accomplish this, the 4th order Runge-Kutta method is used in solving the differential equation before employing both unconstrained, for the parameters, and constrained nonlinear optimization for the allocation of dilution rates. </p>
							The presence of nonlinear grazing by microzooplankton on phytoplankton populations creates challenges in obtaining appropriate data for accurate rate estimates through the dilution technique, specifically in regards to the number of dilutions included in the experiment as well as the levels of those dilutions. This research aimed to optimize the allocation of dilution rates to account for nonlinearity as well as to develop a new method to approximate the, normally unknown, functional response curve to improve upon current methods and models.
							In doing so, this paper demonstrates that a computational approach using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method as well as constrained and unconstrained nonlinear optimization is preferential to other approximated methods, especially in the necessary examination of multiple functional response curves. The results of the preiliminary new method indicated that the inclusion of multiple high dilution samples (<= 0.2), with at least one very highly diluted sample (<= 0.05), provides minimal error for both the parameter estimates as well as the associated functional response curve in comparison to the known true response.
							Therefore, this preliminary new method, though in need of refinement, shows promise as a tool to enhance the dilution technique method as well as to improve the progress and development of current plankton models for estimating the grazing rate of microzooplankton.
