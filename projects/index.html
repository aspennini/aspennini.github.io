							<h2>Classification in Medical Diagnostics</h2>
							<p><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal of this project was to implement the k-nearest neighbor algorithm and Fisher's linear discriminant on the University of Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cytology data set in order to classify the data as either benign or malignant as well as to assess the accuracy of each method.</p> 
							<p><strong>Data:</strong> The raw diagnostic data set included 30 real attributes and 569 instances, 357 of which were labeled benign and 212 labeled as malignant.</p>
							<p><strong>Methods & Analysis:</strong> In the case of k-nearest neighbor classification, there is a general recommendation of a 70/30 split between the training and test sets, respectively. For this assignment, a two-third/one-third split was used as that is similar to the breakdown of the total data set in which 62.74% were classified as benign and teh other 37.26% were malignant. For each of five random training sets, the 1NN, 3NN and Fisher's linear discriminant were applied before predicting the diagnostic classification with the test set and calculating the accuracy and error percentages. Finally, the accuracy and error rates of the five random sets were averaged to determine the final accuracy rates for comparison.</p>		
							<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The results of the analysis showed that, for the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, the higher the value of k, the higher the accuracy of the predictions. However, Fisher's linear discriminant proved to be most accurate among all three methods.</p>

							<h2>Predicting the 2016 US Presidential Election</h2>
							<p>Professor Allan Lichtman of American University has developed a system of predicting the winner of US Presidential elections based on 13 true or false questions he calls <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keys_to_the_White_House"><em>The Keys to the White House</em></a>. The theory places more weight on the current performance of the political party in power than the campaigning of opposing candidates.</p>
							<p><strong>Objective:</strong> The aim of this project was to determine the accuracy of both the decision tree and k-nearest neighbor algorithms on Lichtman's "Keys to the White House" in predicting the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election.</p>
							<p><strong>Data:</strong> Using a modified version of Lichtman's Keys, the data included 12 yes or no questions for elections from 1860 to 1980. The outcomes of these elections included 17 incumbent party winners as well as 13 opposition party winners. In the case of the 2016 election, the questions were answered personally with uncertain questions being tested with both answers.</p>
							<p><strong>Methods & Analysis:</strong> The decision tree algorithm based on information gain was implemented using a minimum split number of 2 initially. In addition, decision trees with minimum splits of 3, 4 and 5 as well as the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, with k=1 and k=3, were tested for comparison purposes.With only data for 30 election, random training sets were composed of 3 incumbent party victories and 2 opposition party victories. The random selection was repeated 7 times for a total of 8 training sets and subsequent test sets. Therefore, the four decision trees and two k-nearest neighbor algorithms were repeated on each of the 8 training sets before predicting the results with the test sets.</p>
							<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The analysis proved that the 3NN algorithm was the most accurate for the test sets as well as predicting the popular vote of the 2016 election. However, none of the methods proved worthwhile for predicting the actual winner of the election due to the formulation of the electoral college.</p>

							<h2>Modeling and Predicting Mortgage Customer Retention</h2>
							<p>A bank, looking to prevent the loss of mortgage customers at the end of the 'lock-in' period, asked for an analysis of customers' personal circumstances to determine if any variables significantly influence the customer's decision to stay or leave the bank.</p>
							<p><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal of the analysis was to develop a generalized linear model that describes the given data as well as provides accurate prediction results for future use.</p>
							<p><strong>Data:</strong> The data provided by the bank include information for 399 of their customers with 23 attributes describing the personal circumstances of the customer. After removing the redundant attributes, 18 explanatory variables were left, consisting of both discrete and continuous variables. In addition, two variables had missing values which were filled with the median/mode in regards to gender and 'Blank' for wealth code.</p>
							<p><strong>Methods & Analysis:</strong> Due to the binary nature of the response variable, logistic regression and stepwise selection were utilized in this analysis. The assessment of model fit was determined using Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion (AIC and BIC), McFadden's pseudo-R-Squared, classification tables as well as residual deviance and p-value in the case of nested models.</p>
							<p>The null model provides the initial comparison for AIC and BIC values. Begining with a single predictor, a set of models are created by adding each explanatory variable tot he null model to determine whether or not their presence improves model fit. For both AIC and BIC, models over the respective minimum are eliminated from further analysis. The minimum AIC and BIC for the set, as well as the maximum R-Squared and calculated accuracy percentages, are noted and used as the comparison values for the next set of models.</p>
							<p>Two predictor models are then created using all combinations of the remaining single predictor models. For three-predictor models and above, only combinations of the previous models are created when one or more common variables is present.</p>
							<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The analysis resulted in a model that shows a significant relationship between a customer's account status and their choice in being a branch user, a direct/telephone user and having an agent. In other words, it is in the bank's best interests to place more importance on customers having a relationship with the bank as well as initiating specific points of contact in order to retain the most business.</p>

							<h2>Optimizing Dilution Rates for Nonlinear Functional Response</h2>
							<p><strong>Objective:</strong> The aim of this project is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the dilution experients by optimizing the allocation of dilution rates. This should produce more accurate estimates for both the phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing rates, especially in the case of nonlinear grazing. </p>				
							<p><strong>Data:</strong> The data used in this research was approximated from the data plots in the article resulting in four sets ranging from 12 to 14 data points.</p>
							<p><strong>Methods:</strong> To accomplish this, the 4th order Runge-Kutta method is used in solving the differential equation before employing both unconstrained, for the parameters, and constrained nonlinear optimization for the allocation of dilution rates.</p>
							<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Multiple functional response curves were analyzed including the Holling Type I and Holling Type II, Ivlev and hyperbolic tangent functional responses. In addition, numerical simulation was performed using a 25% proportional level of noise across the dilution rates.</p>
							<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This research demonstrated that a computational approach using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method as well as constrained and unconstrained nonlinear optimization was preferential to other approximated methods, especially in the necessary examination of multiple functional response curves. The results of the preiliminary new method indicated that the inclusion of multiple high dilution samples (<= 0.2), with at least one very highly diluted sample (<= 0.05), provided minimal error for both the parameter estimates as well as the associated functional response curve in comparison to the known true response.</p>
